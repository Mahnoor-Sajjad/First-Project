<h4>LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h4>
<p>I have made a library system in which there are functions for adding, searching, deleting, issuing and returning a book. However, in the issue and return function there are some 
bugs that needs to be addressed. The problem is that when I enter a book in issue_book which is not issued, then this book is not written in to the temp file. Someone suggested that read 
whole file in a vector, perform or update the status of book and then overwrite in the file, no need of temp file but I do not know how to do that yet so whenever i will learn i will correct
it. :')</p>
